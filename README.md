## üèóÔ∏è Device Architecture

- **CCD Structure:**  
  - Five linear arrays, each with 6000 pixels and distinct sections: imaging area, bias, storage, transfer, two-phase Horizontal Shift Register (HSR), and output.
  - Each array includes anti-blooming regions to prevent charge spillover, and four readouts per array for robust charge-to-voltage conversion and amplification.
  - The full chip integrates 280 pads and 20 readouts, with metal routing subfields for clock and output signals.

- **Pixel Layout:**  
  - Each pixel: 16 √ó 16 Œºm.
  - Pixel block includes photodiode, transfer, storage, bias, anti-blooming, and two-phase HSR (87 Œºm vertical dimension).
  - Layout designed and optimized in **Cadence Virtuoso**.

- **Routing & Assembly:**  
  - Metal routing for clock and output signals is optimized to minimize crosstalk and resistance.
  - The chip (108,000 √ó 12,000 Œºm) is divided into subfields for manufacturability and stitched during lithography.
  - Strategic pad placement ensures efficient interfacing and minimal parasitic effects.
